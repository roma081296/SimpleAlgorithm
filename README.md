Algorithm to find total based on odd &amp; even numbers

Given an array of integers, keep a total score based on the following:
1. Add 1 point for each even number in the array
2. Add 3 points for each odd number in the array
3. Add 5 points for every time you encounter an 8 in the array

Examples:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 11
Input: [15,25,35]
Output: 9
Input: [8,8]
Output: 10
Complete the following code:
public static int find_total(int[] my_numbers ) {
//Insert your code here
}
